'''List	                             Tuple	                                Set	                                        Dictionary
List is a non-homogeneous           Tuple is also a non-homogeneous          Set data structure is also                 Dictionary is also a non-homogeneous 
the elements in single row          row and multiple rows and columns       but stores in single row                    data structure which stores key value pairs
data structure that stores          data structure that stores single       non-homogeneous data structure 
and multiple rows and columns 

List can be represented             Tuple can be represented                Set can be represented                      Dictionary  can be represented 
by [ ]                              by ( )                                  by { }                                      by { }


List allows                         Tuple allows                            Set will not allow                          Dictionary doesn’t 
duplicate elements                  duplicate elements                      duplicate elements                          allow duplicate keys.


List can use nested among all       Tuple can use nested among all          Set can use nested among all                Dictionary can use nested among all


Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]            Example: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)                Example: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}                    Example: {1: “a”, 2: “b”, 3: “c”, 4: “d”, 5: “e”}

List can be created using           Tuple can be created using              Set can be created using                    Dictionary can be created using 
list() function                     tuple() function.                       set() function                              dict() function


List is mutable i.e we can          Tuple  is immutable i.e we can          Set is mutable i.e we can make any          Dictionary is mutable. But Keys 
make any changes in list.           not make any changes in tuple           changes in set. But elements are 	        are not duplicated.
                                    not duplicated.


List is ordered	                    Tuple is ordered	                    Set is unordered	                        Dictionary is ordered (Python 3.7 and above)


Creating an empty list              Creating an empty Tuple                 Creating a set a=set() b=set(a)             Creating an empty dictionary d={}
l=[]                                t=()
